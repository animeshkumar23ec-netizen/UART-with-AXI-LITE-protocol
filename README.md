 STEP 1: Create Directory Structure

In your project folder:

mkdir -p rtl tb docs images scripts

Folders:

    rtl/ → Verilog/SystemVerilog RTL (AXI-Lite Slave, FIFO, UART)

    tb/ → Testbenches

    docs/ → Diagrams, reports (PDFs)

    images/ → PNGs/JPEGs for README or GitHub

    scripts/ → Simulation/Synthesis scripts (Makefile or Bash)
    
    PROJECT DIRECTORY
    
    mkdir -p ~/uart_axi_fifo_proj/{rtl,tb,doc,img,scripts} 
    
cd ~/uart_axi_fifo_proj


    STEP 2: Start Writing RTL (in rtl/)

Create 3 main files:

    axi_lite_slave.v

    fifo.v

    uart_tx.v

    1  FIFO Design Specs (Simplified)

We'll design a parameterized synchronous FIFO with the following features:

    Width and depth configurable

    Clocked on a single clk

    Supports:

        write_en, read_en

        full, empty, data_out

  <img width="602" height="402" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b0d5807-fbd0-44a8-903f-c230e331fcc3" />

FIFO Waveform

    1 Clock (clk)

        Make sure it's toggling consistently (square wave).

    2 Reset (reset)

        Initially high, then goes low → ensures FIFO starts empty.

   3  Write Enable (wr_en) & Write Data (data_in)

        When wr_en is high, check if data_in is stored in FIFO.

   4  Read Enable (rd_en) & Output (data_out)

        When rd_en is high, check if FIFO gives correct data_out (FIFO behavior).

    5 ointers (wr_ptr, rd_ptr)

        Observe how these increment and wrap around.

    6 Flags (full, empty)

        Ensure full goes high when FIFO is full.

        Ensure empty is high initially and clears when data is written.

   shows 
   
    UART transmitter:

    Accepts parallel input (tx_data)

    Sends serial data via tx line (start + 8 bits + stop)

    Raises tx_done when transmission completes

STEP 3: Now that UART TX and FIFO are individually working, you can connect them together so data written into FIFO is transmitted out serially.

Integrate FIFO → UART

New Module: uart_fifo_top.v

This module connects FIFO output to UART input.

<img width="1280" height="800" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/042b7d06-6b6b-4253-b73b-2908c6fa99fa" />

Signal	             Meaning

clk	 --------           Main system clock

reset	--------          Reset pulse at the beginning

write_en	--------      When FIFO is being written

data_in	---------        Data going into FIFO

tx	  --------           Serial transmission (1 bit at a time)

tx_done	--------      UART finished sending a byte

AFTER Now Doing Full Integration!

WE WILL SEE:

  1  FIFO accepting values

  2  UART sending them one by one

  3  tx_done flag triggering FIFO read

  4  Serial waveform on tx line

  Expected Behavior:

    Data written into FIFO (write_en goes high)

    UART transmits bytes one by one (tx waveform toggles serially)

    tx_done goes high at the end of each 10-bit sequence

    FIFO read enabled only when tx_done is high

We just Now Just Built:

A Mini Data Pipeline used in:

    Serial I/O controllers

    Sensor-to-UART bridges

    Embedded SoCs for telemetry/logging

    Low-power UART-based communication

FIFO buffers incoming data

UART sends them serially

Works without parallel bus timing issues

**STEP 4: AXI-Lite Slave block**

It’ll allow:

    Writing to FIFO from a CPU via AXI-Lite interface

    Real-world usage in ARM Cortex SoC + UART combo

 <img width="709" height="408" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b884355-7337-4cd0-9d78-6e9cd9e8f3d9" />

**We’ll implement write-only AXI-Lite, where a CPU or master can write bytes that get stored in a FIFO.**

ALSO 

making ~ axi_lite_slave.v  module — this is the key to interface with a processor or bus system (like an ARM CPU in SoCs)

AXI Signal	Role

s_axi_aw*	------ Write address (not used internally here)

s_axi_w*	------- Data — only wdata[7:0] sent to FIFO

s_axi_b*	------- Sends write response (OKAY)

fifo_wr_en	------Enables FIFO write

fifo_wr_data	----Sends byte to FIFO

**STEP 5 Now Creating top module connecting axi_lite_slave → FIFO → UART**

making ~ axi_fifo_uart_top.v 

<img width="1280" height="800" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7910075a-8d68-4d7f-b0ee-0318b3dea461" />

**axi_fifo_uart_top.v**	----RTL Design	Connects AXI interface, FIFO, and UART TX

Why do we need it?

This file connects all the major components together:

    AXI-Lite Slave (control interface)

    FIFO buffer (temporary storage)

    UART transmitter (serial output)

It is the heart of your system — the full datapath.

What does it do?

    Accepts data via AXI-Lite write transactions

    Stores the data in a FIFO buffer

    Then, automatically sends the data serially through the UART TX line

Internal modules used:

    axi_lite_slave.v → receives 32-bit data via AXI

    fifo.v → stores 8-bit chunks

    uart_tx.v → transmits data over TX serially

We can’t verify RTL code without a testbench.

**tb_axi_fifo_uart_top.v** ---- 	Simulates CPU-like AXI writes + dumps waveform

This testbench simulates the AXI writes and allows us to:

    Observe the FIFO being written

    Observe UART transmission starting automatically

    Validate correct data flow from AXI → FIFO → UART

⚙️ What does it do?

    Creates clock & reset

    Sends 3 AXI-style writes (s_axi_awvalid, s_axi_wdata)

    Waits for UART to transmit the data

    Dumps all signals into tb_axi_fifo_uart_top.vcd for GTKWave



Python GUI simulation that visually shows:

    ✅ AXI-style data writes

    ✅ FIFO buffer (filling & emptying)

    ✅ UART TX signal (bit stream visualizer)

    ✅ Optional: ASCII output of TX line

**Why You See 10 Blocks for One Byte?**

Each UART transmission frame consists of the following 10 bits:
Bit Position	Bit Type	Description
0	Start Bit	Always 0, signals start of transmission
1–8	Data Bits	8 bits of data, sent LSB first
9	Stop Bit	Always 1, signals end of transmission

## RTL to GDSII 

STEP 1: Design Entry (RTL)

 Files: uart.v, fifo.v, top.v

Tools: Any code editor

This is behavioral/synthesizable logic – the starting point of the design.

STEP 2: RTL Simulation (Functional Verification)

   Tool: Icarus Verilog + GTKWave

    Goal: Check functionality using testbench

iverilog -o uart_tb.vvp uart.v uart_tb.v
vvp uart_tb.vvp
gtkwave dump.vcd

Ensure your design behaves correctly before synthesis.

3 open lane synthesis occured

 full flow in OpenLane is completed 
 
File	Purpose

gds/fifo.gds-----	Full layout

lef/fifo.lef-----	Abstract layout

def/fifo.def-----	Placement + routing

verilog/fifo.v-----	Final netlist

sdc/fifo.sdc----	Clock constraints

spef/fifo.spef----Parasitic extraction

sta/----Timing reports

STEP 4: LOGIC SYNTHESIS 

Logic synthesis is the process of converting your RTL (Verilog code) into a gate-level netlist using standard cells from the PDK (e.g., NANDs, NORs, flip-flops, etc.).

STEP 5 FLOORPLANNING/ PLACEMENT

The GDS layout shows the placed standard cells within the floorplanned core area. The placement follows the defined rows and is aligned to the floorplan structure (die area, IOs, power straps). The view reflects the post-placement and pre-routing state of the physical design.

<img width="669" height="217" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/811add8c-0f07-4411-b842-1c0ba078cb08" />

screenshot is not just floorplan, it is a post-placement view, meaning:

  1  The floorplan has already been done: chip dimensions, power straps, IOs, rows, etc.

  2  AND cells have been placed: those blocks of green/yellow/blue are standard cells.








































































  ✅ 1. Use OpenLane’s Built-in Summary Command

After the flow is completed successfully (like you did earlier):

cd /openlane
flow.tcl -design fifo_design -report_summary

This will print a clean summary in the terminal with:

    Area

    Cell count

    Worst Slack

    Leakage & Dynamic power

    Timing violations

    DRC/LVS results

    Final GDS and netlists
